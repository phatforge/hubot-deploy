## Configuration

`hubot-deploy` looks for an `apps.json` file in the root of your deployed hubot to map names to specific repos that should be deployed. Here's what the format looks like.

```JSON
{
  "hubot": {
    "provider": "heroku",
    "repository": "MyOrg/my-org-hubot",
    "environments": ["production"],

    "heroku_name": "my-orgs-hubot"
  },

  "dotcom": {
    "provider": "heroku",
    "repository": "MyOrg/www",
    "environments": ["production","staging"],

    "heroku_name": "my-org-www",
    "heroku_staging_name": "my-org-www-staging"
  }
}
```

Each entry can take a few attributes.

* **provider**: One of dpl's [supported providers](https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl#supported-providers).
* **environments**: An array of environments that you can deploy to.
* **heroku\_name**: The name of the heroku app to push to.
* **heroku\_staging\_name**: The name of the heroku app to push to.
